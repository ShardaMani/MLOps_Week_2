MLOps Iris Project with DVC
This project demonstrates a reproducible machine learning workflow for the Iris dataset.

It uses Git to track source code and DVC (Data Version Control) to manage large files like datasets and trained models. This hybrid approach ensures that every part of an experiment—code, data, and model—is versioned together.

The core benefit is reproducibility. By checking out a specific version tag (e.g., v1.0), we can instantly restore the exact dataset and model from that experiment, making it easy to track our work and reliably reproduce any result.
